Do not start the engine again until the oil and filter is changed. Look under the hood for leaks. Start at the injector pump and follow the fuel lines to the fuel injector rail. Look at the injectors for signs of leaks. Pull the electrical connector off the fuel pressure sensor and look for fuel in the connector. A failed sensor will allow fuel up through the sensor into the connector. Check when you last changed the fuel filter. A plugged fuel filter will drop the volume enough to set the code. Check all electrical connectors on the sensors and wiring harness to the injectors for missing insulation, corrosion or loose connections. If no obvious leaks have been found, go online and look up the TSBs (technical service bulletins) for your year and make vehicle. Diesels have no lack of problems as the TSBs will indicate.  "
